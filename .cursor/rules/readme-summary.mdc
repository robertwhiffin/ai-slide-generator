We will be building a web app. Please keep a short README.md that summarizes the purpose of the project, specifies technologies used and why, and how to get started using it. After each request, determine if this needs to be changed, and update it if so.

When README changes are warranted, cross-check the companion technical docs in `docs/technical/` (frontend overview, backend overview, slide parser & script management, etc.) and update them whenever the underlying behavior changes.

Only modify README files as part of a commit. When preparing a commit, ask whether the README (and related technical docs) should be updated before proceeding.
