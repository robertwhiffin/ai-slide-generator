Ensure the service behaves like a singleton. That is, there should only be a single connection offered at once. If the connection doesn't yet exist on a call to query(), it creates the connection. If the connection is expired (that is, the time this connection was made was >59 minutes ago), it refreshes the connection.

should expose as functional services like: **Lakebase.query()**, where the class is called Lakebase. this function should accept a string query, and return the rows if the query was successful or throw the encountered error if not. Do not manipulate the data afterwards or put it into a dataframe - return it as it is.

**CRITICAL**: The query() method must ALWAYS call both cursor.fetchall() AND connection.commit() for every query, regardless of query type (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), because all queries should be RETURNING \*. This ensures:

1. INSERT/UPDATE queries with RETURNING clauses return their results to the frontend (RETURNING \*)
2. All transactions are properly committed to the database
3. Consistent behavior across all query types

eg

```python
with self._connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(sql)

    rows = cursor.fetchall()
    self._connection.commit()
    return rows
```
